# **LuxeVista Resort \- Android Application**

**LuxeVista** is a comprehensive, native Android application designed for a luxury beachfront resort. It serves as a digital concierge, allowing guests to seamlessly browse accommodations, reserve exclusive in-house services, and manage their stay. The application is built entirely with native Java and the Android SDK, utilizing a local SQLite database for all data persistence.

This project was developed as a primary assessment for the Mobile Application Development module (CSE5011), demonstrating a full range of Android development skills from UI/UX design to complex database management.

* **Session Management:** Uses SharedPreferences to maintain a user session after login.  
* **Personalized Experience:** The Home and Profile screens greet the user by their registered name.

* **Advanced Filtering & Sorting:** Users can:  
  * **Search** for rooms by name in real-time.  
  * **Filter** the list by room type (e.g., Suite, Villa).  
  * **Sort** the list by price (Low to High or High to Low).  
* **Detailed Room View:** Each room has a dedicated details page with a larger image and full description.  
* **Date-Specific Booking:** A complete booking flow allows users to select check-in and check-out dates using a native DatePickerDialog, with validation to prevent check-out before check-in.

#### **üõéÔ∏è In-House Service Reservations**

* **Comprehensive Service Menu:** Displays 20 distinct services across 4 categories (Spa Treatment, Fine Dining, Poolside Cabanas, Guided Beach Tour).

## **üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack & Architecture**

* **Language:** **Java**  
* **Platform:** **Native Android (Android SDK)**  
* **Database:** **SQLite** for all local data persistence.  
* **UI:**  
  * **XML** for creating layouts.  
  * **Material Design Components:** CardView, BottomNavigationView, SearchView, Spinner.  
  * RecyclerView for displaying dynamic and efficient lists.  
* **Architecture:**  
  * **Activities & Fragments:** The app uses a Single-Activity architecture (MainActivity) to host multiple Fragments, providing a modern and efficient navigation structure.

  * **Adapters (**RecyclerView.Adapter**):** Custom adapters (RoomAdapter, ServicesAdapter, BookingAdapter) act as the bridge between the data source and the UI lists.  
  * **Data Models:** Simple Java objects (Room, ServiceItem, etc.) are used to model the application's data structure.

## **üöÄ Setup and Installation**

To run this project:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:  
   git clone https://github.com/Viranya2006/LuxeVista-Android-App.git

2. Open the project in **Android Studio**.  
3. Let Gradle sync and build the project.  
4. Run the application on an Android emulator or a physical device.

**Note:** The application uses a local SQLite database. If you make any changes to the database schema in DBHelper.java, you must increment the DATABASE\_VERSION constant and perform a clean install by uninstalling the app from the device before running it again. This will trigger the onUpgrade method and correctly rebuild the database.
